1.  Introduction

   Various slicing efforts are being conduced within various IETF WGs
   (e.g., teas, idr, spring, ccamp, mpls, opsawg, 6man, and ippm) and
   areas (e.g., rtg, int, tsv, and ops).  All these efforts are
   referring to the IETF framework that is developed by the teas WG
   (Section 2), however there is a lack of a global visibility about
   these efforts and their interdependency.

   Also, there is a lack of cross-WG communications in some cases when a
   slicing-related specification is candidate for adoption or adopted by
   a WG.  This lack of global view at the IETF level and lack of early
   cross-WG communications may induce some inconsistency.  For example,
   some proposals argue in favor of specifying extensions to convey
   specific identifiers in packets.  However, distinct identifiers are
   being proposed: slice identifier, NRP Selector, NRP identifier, VTN
   identifier, VTN resource identifier, etc.  The need and relationship
   between these identifiers are worth to be discussed independent of
   the channels that are used to convey these identifiers.

   This document provides an overview of slicing activities in the IETF
   to hopefully ease coordination and ensure that specifications that
   are developed in many WGs are consistent, e.g.:

   *  Position the various concepts: network slice, network resource
      partition, virtual transport network, etc.

   *  Clarify the need of the various identifiers introduced so far and
      soften redundant/duplicate uses.

   *  Harmonize the definition of relevant identifiers (length,
      encoding, usage, etc.) rather than having the specification of the
      same identifier repeated in many places.  For example, current
      specifications use distinct encoding length of the same attribute
      (variable, 16-bit, 32-bit).

   *  Clarify the relationship and co-existence of identifiers if more
      than one is needed.

2.  Reference Framework and Architecture

   [RFC9543] is the authoritative IETF framework for Network Slices.  It
   provides definitions for a slice-related core terms and specifies a
   framework for the provision of Network Slice Services over networks
   that are deployed using technologies that are owned by the IETF (IP,
   MPLS, etc.).  The document refers to such slices as IETF Network
   Slice or "the term "RFC 9543 Network Slice".

   [RFC9543] provides a clear distinction between:

   *  the "RFC 9543 Network Slice Service" which is the service
      delivered to the customer and which is agnostic to the
      technologies and mechanisms used by the service provider, and

   *  the "RFC 9543 Network Slice" which is the realization of the
      service in the service provider's network achieved by partitioning
      network resources and by applying a set of mechanisms within the
      network.

   The RFC 9543 Network Slice Service is specified in terms of:

   *  a set of Service Demarcation Point (SDP),

   *  a set of one or more connectivity constructs between subsets of
      these SDPs, and

   *  a set of service objectives for each SDP sending to each
      connectivity construct.

   The service objectives can be expressed as Service Level Objectives
   (SLOs) or Service Level Expectations (SLEs).

   In some deploymenets, the underlying network can be customized to
   select a subset of resources that are suitable for the delivery of an
   RFC 9543 Network Slice Service.  Such a customization can be achieved
   by creating a set of Network Resource Partitions (NRPs).

   In other deployments, RFC 9543 Network Slices can be hosted directly
   on the underlay network (i.e., without requiring any NRP).

   RFC 9543 Network Slices can be realized using existing tools
   (Section 3.1).  The extensions listed in Section 6 or Section 7 are
   not required in such a case.

   [RFC9543] does not provide any recommendation about the technological
   means to realize an RFC 9543 Network Slice Service.  These
   considerations are deployment specific.

3.  Models for Realizing Network Slices

3.1.  Using Current IP/MPLS Technologies

   [RFC9889] describes a model for the realization of RFC 9543 Network
   Slices for 5G networks.  This realization model reuses many building
   blocks that are commonly used in service provider networks,
   specifically:

   *  L2VPN/L3VPN service instances for logical separation,

   *  Fine-grained resource control at the PE,

   *  Coarse resource control at the transit, and

   *  Capacity planning/management for efficient usage of provider
      network resources.

3.2.  Using Network Resource Partitions (NRPs) and Slice-Flow Aggregates

   [I-D.ietf-teas-ns-ip-mpls] proposes a model that is inspired from the
   Diffserv model for the realization of Network Slices over IP/MPLS
   networks.  Specifically, this model introduces the concept of Slice-
   Flow Aggregate which is defined as a collection of packets that are
   mapped to an NRP and are given the same forwarding treatment in a
   shared network.  An aggregate can group flows from of one or more RFC
   9543 Network Slice Services.

   [I-D.ietf-teas-ns-ip-mpls] also introduces the notion of NRP Policy
   that is used to trigger the creation of NRPs that will support a
   given Slice-Flow Aggregate.  In some deployment schemes, packets that
   belong to a Slice-Flow Aggregate are forwarded by intermediate node
   along the appropriate NRP by processing an NRP Selector that is
   carried by these packets.

3.3.  Optical Transport Networks (OTN) Slicing

   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-yang-otn-slicing] defines Optical Transport Networks
   (OTN) slice as an OTN virtual network topology connecting a number of
   OTN endpoints using a set of shared or dedicated OTN network
   resources to satisfy specific SLOs.  OTN slices are considered as a
   technology-specific realization of an RFC 9543 Network Slice in the
   OTN domain.

3.4.  VPN+

   [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] describes a framework for providing
   enhanced VPN services based upon VPN and Traffic Engineering (TE)
   technologies.  Enhanced VPN (VPN+) can be used for the realization of
   Network Slices.  This document introduces the concept of Virtual
   Transport Network (VTN), which is a virtual underlay network
   consisting of a subset of network resources allocated from the
   physical underlay network, and is associated with a customized
   network topology.

3.5.  Instantiation in Service Providers Networks

   [I-D.ietf-teas-ns-models-applicability] focuses on the instantiation
   of the RFC 9543 Network Slice Services in service provider networks
   using existing data models.  In particular, this document describes
   the relationship between service models for managing the RFC 9543
   Network Slice Services and network models (e.g., the Layer-3 Network
   Model (L3NPM, [RFC9182]), the Layer-2 Network Model (L2NM [RFC9291]))
   used for the realization of the slices.

3.6.  Structuring Network Slice Controllers

   [I-D.ietf-teas-ns-controller-models] proposes an approach for
   structuring the RFC 9543 Network Slice Controller as well as how to
   use different data models being defined for RFC 9543 Network Slice
   Service provision.

3.7.  SR-based Hierarchical Network Slices

   [I-D.gong-spring-hierarchical-slice-solution] proposes a hierarchical
   approach for realizing RFC 9543 Network Slices in Segment Routing
   domain.  The approach involves two levels:

   *  Level 1 Network Slices are realized using Flex-Algo.

   *  Level 2 forwarding paths are restricted in the Level 1 topology by
      using SR Policy and NRP-ID in the data plane.

3.8.  Realization of Composite Network Slices

   [I-D.li-teas-composite-network-slices] investigates a set of
   scenarios for realizing composite RFC 9543 Network Slices (that
   basically involve other slices).  The document defines a new
   identifier, called Inter-domain NRP ID.

3.9.  AAA for Hierarchical Network Slices

   [I-D.zhang-rtgwg-aaa-hierarchical-network-slices] describes an
   authentication, authorization, and accounting process for
   hierarchical Network Slices.  The document suggest adding NRP-ID to
   accounting meesages, but lacks a discussion whether any protocol
   extension is needed.

4.  Applicability and Mapping Scenarios

4.1.  3GPP 5G End-to-End Network Slices

   [I-D.ietf-teas-5g-network-slice-application] focuses on the
   application of RFC 9543 Network Slices in the context of the 3GPP 5G
   slices.

4.2.  Enforcement of 5G End-to-End Network Slice QoS

   [I-D.cbs-teas-5qi-to-dscp-mapping] documents an example of possible
   mapping of 5QI values to DSCP markings with a focus on 5G Network
   Slices.  The document groups different 5QI types in classes based on
   their SLOs.

4.3.  Encoding 3GPP Slices for Interactive Media Services

   [I-D.jiang-tsvwg-slice-media-service] explores how IETF schemes (DSCP
   and UDP options) can be used to expose some QoS-related metadata for
   specific flows to 5GS.  The document focuses on the Extended Reality
   & multi-modality communication (XRM) service.

4.4.  Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN)

   [I-D.ietf-teas-applicability-actn-slicing] describes the
   applicability of ACTN to Network Slicing.

4.5.  Mobility-Aware Transport Network Slicing

   [I-D.ietf-dmm-tn-aware-mobility] discusses a mapping of 5G slices to
   RFC 9543 Network Slices when the transport network is separated from
   the networks in which the 5G network functions are deployed (e.g., 5G
   functions distributed across data centers).  This document zooms into
   the use of UDP source port number in GTP-U outer header and LAN to
   map between a 5G slice and corresponding RFC 9543 Network Slice
   segments that is listed in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-5g-network-slice-application].

   The document specifies an ACaaS extension
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit] to support a layer 3 GTP-U
   (or UDP encapsulated GTP) bearer as an attachment circuit.

4.6.  DetNet

   [I-D.sw-detnet-network-slice-mapping-yang] describes the
   applicability of DetNet to RFC 9543 Network Slice, particularly to
   provide deterministic services.  The document describes how to use
   DetNet flow aggregation as the Slice-Flow Aggregates over an
   underlying NRP following the approach in Section 3.2.

5.  Orchestration and Data Models

   Figure 1 provides an example of the various data models that can be
   invoked in the context of Network Slicing.

         Figure 1: Overview of Data Models used for Network Slicing

5.1.  Common Models

   [RFC9181] specifies a set of reusable types and groupings to manage
   VPN services.  Note that VPNs are used for the realization of Network
   Slices.

   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-common-ac] specifies a set of reusable types
   and groupings to manage Attachment Circuits (ACs).

5.2.  Service Models

5.2.1.  Attachment Circuit as a Service (ACaaS) Data Model

   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit] specifies YANG data models
   for managing 'Attachment Circuits'-as-a-Service (ACaaS) and also
   bearers.  These ACs and bearers are used to identify where to deliver
   a slice service.

5.2.2.  Network Slice Service Data Model

   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang] defines a YANG data model
   for manaing RFC 9543 Network Slice Services.

5.3.  Network Models

5.3.1.  Service Attachment Points (SAPs)

   [RFC9408] defines a YANG data model for representing an abstract view
   of the provider network topology that contains the points from which
   its services can be attached (e.g., basic connectivity, VPN, network
   slices).  Also, the model can be used to retrieve the points where
   the services are actually being delivered to customers (including
   peer networks).

   A SAP network topology can be used for one or multiple service types
   ('service-type').  Setting this data node to 'network-slice' allows a
   controller to expose where RFC 9543 Network Slices services are being
   delivered.  It can also be used to check where RFC 9543 Network Slice
   Services can be delivered.

5.3.2.  AC-augmented SAPs

   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit] augments the SAP model with
   more details for managing ACs at the network level.

5.3.3.  Network Slice Topology

   [I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang] specifies a YANG model
   for RFC 9543 Network Slice Topology with on exposing a customized
   topology that contains a topology intent with required SLO/SLEs to
   express the customer’s intent for resource reservation.

   The need for such a model is yet to be justified as the current scope
   is redundant with, e.g., what can be already achieved using
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang].  The authors should motivate why
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] is not sufficient.

5.3.4.  Network Resource Partitions (NRPs)

   [I-D.ietf-teas-nrp-yang] specifies a YANG data model for managing
   NRPs.

5.3.5.  Network Slice Mapping

   [I-D.dhody-teas-ietf-network-slice-mapping] specifies an RFC 9543
   Network Slice Service mapping YANG model.  The model supports the
   following mappings:

   *  L3NM [RFC9182]

   *  L2NM [RFC9291]

   *  TE [I-D.ietf-teas-te-service-mapping-yang]

   *  NRP

6.  Control Plane Extensions

6.1.  BGP Classful Transport Planes

   [RFC9832] specifies mechanisms for classifying underlay routes into a
   set of classes, called Transport Classes, and mapping service-
   specific routes to a specific Transport Class.  For example,
   [RFC9832] can be used to create a customized topology for Network
   Slices.  These topologies (Transport Classes) will be typically
   created to satisfy certain TE characteristics.  A new Transport Class
   Route Target Extended Community is defined for this purpose.  A
   Transport Class is identified by a 4-octet identifier: Transport
   Class ID.

6.2.  BGP Color-Aware Routing (CAR)

   [RFC9871] specifies a new BGP SAFI called BGP Color-Aware Routing
   (BGP CAR).  Colors are defined to characterize an objective (e.g.,
   low latency).  To satisfy Network Slice requirements, CAR may be used
   to establish paths that address specific objectives.  These paths
   will be associated with a Color.

   The proposal leverages the BGP Color Extended Community defined in
   [RFC9012] and builds upon the Color concept defined in [RFC9256].  In
   addition, a new Extended Community, called Local-Color-Mapping (LCM)
   Extended Community, is defined to address cases where the granularity
   of the exposed colors differs when crossing domains.

6.3.  Network Resource Partitions (NRPs)

6.3.1.  BGP Flowspec

   [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-network-slice-ts] specifies a BGP Flowspec
   extension for NRP traffic steering.

6.3.2.  BGP-LS NRP Filters in SR

   [I-D.drake-teas-bgp-ls-filter-nrp] specifies new BGP-LS attributes,
   called BGP-LS Filters, for NRPs in SR networks.  A BGP-LS Filter
   provides a description of a subset of the links and nodes in an
   underlay network.  Ingress PE selects a path to an egress PE from the
   topology defined by the BGP-LS Filters it has imported for a given
   VPN.

   [I-D.chen-idr-bgp-ls-transport-slice] adds new BGP-LS attribute TLVs
   to encode information such as NRP-ID.

6.3.3.  BGP NRP Extensions

   [I-D.dong-idr-bgp-nrp-policy] specifies extensions to BGP to
   advertise NRPs to the network nodes involved in the NRP.

6.3.4.  BGP-LS NRP Extensions

   [I-D.dong-idr-bgp-ls-scalable-nrp] specifies extensions to BGP Link-
   State (BGP-LS) to advertise NRPs to network controllers.

6.3.5.  SR Policies Extensions

6.3.5.1.  BGP

   [I-D.ietf-idr-sr-policy-nrp] and [I-D.liu-idr-bgp-network-slicing]
   define extensions to BGP in order to advertise NRP ID in an SR
   Policy.  The NRP ID is encoded in 4 octets.

6.3.5.2.  BGP-LS

   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ls-sr-policy-nrp] specifies SR Policy extensions
   for NRP in BGP-LS.  The NRP ID is encoded in 4 octets.

6.3.6.  PCEP Extensions

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-nrp] specifie Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions for NRP.  The NRP ID is
   encoded in 4 octets.

6.4.  Virtual Transport Networks (VTNs)

6.4.1.  IS-IS MT

   [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-sr-vtn-mt] specifies how to use IS-IS Multi-
   Topology (MT) for SR-based VTNs.

6.4.2.  BGP-LS

   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-sr-vtn-mt] describes a mechanism to distribute
   the information of SR-based VTNs to the network controller using BGP-
   LS with Multi-Topology.

7.  Data Plane Extensions

7.1.  Slice Identifier in the MPLS Entropy Label

   [I-D.decraene-mpls-slid-encoded-entropy-label-id] proposes an
   approach to encode slice identifiers in a portion of the MPLS Entropy
   Label (EL).  The number of bits to be used for encoding the slice
   identifier in the EL is policy-based.  Transit LSRs uses the slice
   identifier in the EL to apply per-slice policies.

7.2.  Slice Identifier in IPv6 Flow Label

   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-stateless-slice-id] proposes to encode
   slice identifers in a portion of the IPv6 Flow Label.  Slice
   identifiers are used by intermediate IPv6 routers to process the
   packet according to a network slice policy.

7.3.  Slice Identifier in the Source Address of Encapsulated SRH

   When an ingress SR router encapsulates a packet in an IPv6 packet
   with an SRH, [I-D.cheng-spring-srv6-encoding-network-sliceid]
   suggests to use the least significant bits of the outer IPv6 source
   address to encode a slide identifier.  SLID Presence Indicator (SPI)
   is used to indicate the presence of a slice identifier.  The number
   of bits used to encode slice identifiers is local to an SR domain.

7.4.  VTN Resource ID in an IPv6 Extension Header

   [I-D.ietf-6man-enhanced-vpn-vtn-id] describes a mechanism to carry an
   identifier, called VTN resource ID, in the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop extension
   header.  The document claims that "VTN resource ID" is equivalent to
   NRP-ID, but does motivate why another yet ID is thus needed rather
   than using "NRP-ID".

   The length of the VTN ID depends on the context type.  When CT=0, the
   VTN ID is a 4-octet ID.

7.5.  Network Resource Partitions (NRPs)

7.5.1.  Resource-aware Segments

   An NRP can be represented in SR networks using a set of NRP-specific
   resource-aware segments [I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments]
   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn].

7.5.2.  NRP ID in SRv6

   [I-D.liu-spring-nrp-id-in-srv6-segment] specifies an approach to
   encode the NRP ID in the SRH.  This ID is used by intermediate IPv6
   routers to identify the NRP to be used for forwarding.  The encoding
   of the NRP ID in an IPv6 address is variable; an instruction is thus
   needed to help identifyint the NRP-ID position (e.g., low 16 bits).

7.5.3.  NRP Selector in MPLS Network Actions

   As mentioned in Section 3.2, packets that are associated with a
   Slice-Flow Aggregate may carry an NRP Selector (NRPS).  This selector
   is intended to be conveyed in the packet's network layer header to
   identify the flow aggregate to which a packet belongs.
   [I-D.li-mpls-mna-nrp-selector] investigates a set of options to use
   MPLS Network Actions (MNA) to carry the NRPS:

   *  13-bit NRP Selector (NRPS13) Action

   *  20-bit NRP Selector (NRPS20) Action

   *  20-bit Entropy and NRP Selector (ENRPS20) Action

7.5.4.  SRv6 Resource Programming

   [I-D.gong-spring-srv6-nrp-flavor] defines a new SRv6 Endpoint
   behavior [RFC8986] to associate a SID with a set of NRPs.

8.  OAM

8.1.  LSP Ping/Traceroute Extensions

   [I-D.liu-mpls-lsp-ping-nrp] specifies extenstions to the LSP Ping/
   Traceroute to convey NRP-ID in SR domains.

   The NRP-ID is a encoded as a 4-octet field.

8.2.  Precision Availability Metrics (PAM)

   [RFC9544] introduces a new set of metrics, called Precision
   Availability Metrics (PAM).  These metrics are used to assess whether
   a service (e.g., Network Slice Service) is provided in compliance
   with its specified SLOs.

   [I-D.clemm-opsawg-pam-ipfix] specifies a set of new IP Flow
   Information Export (IPFIX) Information Elements to export precision
   availability data associated with Flows.  These Information Elements
   are specifically designed to indicate compliance of a Flow with an
   SLO.

8.3.  IPFIX Information Elements for NRP

   [I-D.liu-opsawg-ipfix-network-slice] explores how to use IPFIX to
   export NRP IDs.  However, there is currently no one single stable/
   authoritative specification of NRP-ID.  This identifier is being
   proposed as data plane and control plane extensions.  These proposals
   do not share the same ID format.

   The initial version of [I-D.liu-opsawg-ipfix-network-slice] does
   explain which plan is used, in which layer the ID was exported, etc.
   Defining an IPFIX IE is useful for network observability, however
   there is no stable specification yet of the ID to be exported.

8.4.  PAM-based Path Computation

   [I-D.contreras-pce-pam] specifies a new PCEP object (PRECISION
   METRIC) for path calculation with performance requirements expressed
   as SLOs.  The new PCEP object uses the attributes defined in
   [RFC9544].

9.  Misc

9.1.  Scalability Considerations for NRP

   [I-D.ietf-teas-nrp-scalability] discusses a set of scenarios for the
   deployment of NRP with a focus on scalability implications.  The
   document reasons about the increase of requested RFC 9543 Network
   Slice Services that would require NRPs.  Such an increase of slices
   is speculative at this stage.

9.2.  Deployment Considerations

   [I-D.ma-teas-ietf-network-slice-deployment] reports a set of
   "deployments" from various network operators and identifies some
   considerations for operating Network Slices (e.g., scalability and
   automation).  Most of these reported cases rely upon SRv6.  The
   document does not provide enough details whether these "deployments"
   are for testing purposes or reflect setups to carry customers'
   traffic.

10.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations of the mechanisms listed in the document are
   discussed in the relevant documents that specify these mechanisms.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not make any request to IANA.
